# Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (JavaScript)

Contained in this repository are my own implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms using ES6.  

My purpose for building this repo is my own edification (after a hiatus from developing software). I'd like to use this project to refresh my faculties with these concepts which are considered by all to be fundamental to programming. 

My target outcome is that through this process I'll become more adept at solving problems (the kind found on sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com)). My idea of reaching that target involves being able to create efficient solutions, as well as being able to speak coherently about my decisions to use specific data structures and algorithms in terms of space and time complexity.  

Yes, I'm kinda reinventing the wheel. No, I'm absolutely not [Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) – I'll be linking all the resources I use for learning as I go along (likely included in accompanying Markdown files with each implementation that'll also include relevant notes).
